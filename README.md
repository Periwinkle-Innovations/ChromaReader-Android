ChromaReader Android App
========================

The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use app for both experienced,
involved veterans of the Chroma wars and fresh, new recruits.
It aims to provide an interactive and up-to-date map of Chroma, to use push
notifications to alert users of upcoming battles, to chronicle Chroma lore, and
to provide easy-to-use mobile access to public chat.

This project is still currently in the planing phase, and any suggestions would
be greatly appreciated.

Setting up the Development Environment
======================================

1. Install Kivy's Python for Android (not Kivy itself) following the
   instructions [here](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/blob/master/README.rst)
   * This will require installing both the Android SDK and the Android NDK
